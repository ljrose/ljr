          not only understood how to use the eight or so Unix interfaces presented 
          to her, she analyzed their strengths and weaknesses, and extracted a 
          very insightful compendium of recommendations which the A/UX group has 
          found to be invaluable.</font></p>

          have had the opportunity to observe Lisa in a public leadership role, 
          that of &quot;Block Captain&quot; for our Neighborhood Watch Committee. 
          During a time of crisis, when a serial rapist was operating in our neighborhood, 
          Lisa had the generosity and wisdom to volunteer her time to organize 
          our block. With the help of the Community Police people, Lisa very effectively 
          and efficiently provided leadership and organization for meetings and 
          activities. She displayed a levelheaded, calming, reasonable and balanced 
          perspective in a frightening and emotion laden situation. Having been 
          to very many meetings in my life, I can say these were the most efficiently 
          run I've ever had the pleasure of attending.</font></p>
